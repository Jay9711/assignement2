- Open the colab notebook The link would be in the file or just download the notebook.
>Step 1 : Import the rt_reviews.csv file in the same folder as the notebook
>Step 2 : Run Cells from 1 to 9. You will be able to see the accuracy with the simplest model.
>_Cells 10 and 11 are only to show the experiments that i have done so you can leave them aside_
>Step 3 : Run cells 12 to 15 to see the accuracy of the model with data pre _ processing 
>Step 4: Run cells 16 to 19. 
>_Cells 20 and 21 are only to show the experiments that i have done so you can leave them aside_
>Step 5: Run cells 22 to see how la place smoothing improves accuracy with different alpha. 
>Step 6: Run cells 21 , 24, 25 to see the best result for Development and Testing accuracy.
